# WordSearch

Word Search is a simple paper-pencil game for multiple players and the goal of this assignment is to implement the Word Search game in Java. 

The Word Search game is played on a two-dimensional board that is filled with letters. The board can have any size and the program should be able to dynamically accommodate any size.

In the Word Search game, the players take turns and try to find words that occur on the board, which are imported from one of the twelve CSV files. Every word can only be chosen once, but their letters can be picked multiple times if they are part of another word. Words can have any possible orientation, i.e. from left to
right, right to left, top to bottom, bottom to top and diagonally in all four directions. 

The player that finds the most words wins.
